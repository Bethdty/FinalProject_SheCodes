# FinalProject_SheCodes

This is the final project for my SheCodes assessment. 
I was required to build a simple landing page for something I enjoy, however I feel I went over the brief.
I learnt a lot of new skills while doing this, and thoroughly enjoyed the process.
I am aware that there are a lot of improvements that can be made, but for my first jump into WebDev I'm quite pleased.

## Coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
